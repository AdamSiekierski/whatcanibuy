Ever wanted to quickly compare some amount of money to things? Or didn't know what to buy someone for some price? Check out this app!

[whatcanibuy](https://whatcanibuy.vercel.app) given some amount of money will show you thing, that you can buy for that. We have a small database containing some tech or geeky products!

The App is made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - a new, light JavaScript framework for making web apps, being an alternative to React or Vue.

### Contributing

We're open to all contributions! Add your products to some price ranges (in `src/data/values.json` file), sumbit a PR, and _eventually_ we will merge it!

It is also a great opportunity for people attending the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
